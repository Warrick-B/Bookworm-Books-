    <h2>Description</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="textCenter">Fifty years after its original publication, Catch-22 remains a cornerstone of American
      literature and one of the funniest and most
      celebrated books of all time. In recent years it has been named to best novels lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern
      Library, and the London Observer.
      Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero
      who is furious because thousands of
      people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy it is his own army, which
      keeps increasing the number of missions the
      men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous
      missions he s assigned, he'll be in violation
      of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly
      dangerous combat missions, but if he
      makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.
