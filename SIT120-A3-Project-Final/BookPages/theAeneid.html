    <h2>Description</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="textCenter">The Aeneid is an epic poem, written by Virgil between 29 and 19 BC, that tells the legendary
      story of Aeneas, a Trojan who travelled to Italy, where he became
      the ancestor of the Romans. It comprises 9,896 lines in dactylic hexameter. The first six of the poem's twelve
      books tell the story of Aeneas's wanderings from Troy to Italy, and the
      poem's second half tells of the Trojans' ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and
      his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed. The hero Aeneas was
      already known to Greco-Roman legend and myth, having been a character in the Iliad. Virgil took the disconnected
      tales of Aeneas's wanderings, his vague association with the
      foundation of Rome and a personage of no fixed characteristics other than a scrupulous pietas, and fashioned this
      into a compelling founding myth or national epic that at once tied
      Rome to the legends of Troy, explained the Punic Wars, glorified traditional Roman virtues, and legitimized the
      Julio-Claudian dynasty as descendants of the founders, heroes,
      and gods of Rome and Troy. The Aeneid is widely regarded as Virgil's masterpiece and one of the greatest works of
      Latin literature.
