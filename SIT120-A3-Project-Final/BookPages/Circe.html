    <h2>Description</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="textCenter">In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But
      Circe is a strange child--not powerful, like her father,
      nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she
      does possess power--the power of witchcraft, which can
      transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves. Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island,
      where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and
      crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his
      doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course,
      wily Odysseus.But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of
      both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against
      one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all
      her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs
      with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.
